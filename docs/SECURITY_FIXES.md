# Security Fixes Applied to Capstone System

## Overview
This document outlines all the critical security flaws that were identified and fixed in the capstone system.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Password Security - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Plaintext passwords were stored in Firestore and compared directly
**Solution**: 
- Removed all plaintext password storage from client-side code
- Updated `createAccount.js` and `script.js` to use server API endpoints
- Server-side bcrypt hashing is now properly utilized
- All password comparisons now use secure bcrypt verification

**Files Modified**:
- `createAccount.js` - Lines 427-453
- `script.js` - Lines 294-318
- `adminChecker.js` - Complete rewrite to use secure API

### 2. Authentication System - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Dual authentication systems with client-side bypassing server security
**Solution**:
- Created `js/secureAuth.js` - Centralized secure authentication module
- Integrated with existing server-side JWT authentication
- Removed direct Firestore queries for authentication
- Added automatic token refresh mechanism
- Proper session management with secure logout

**Files Created**:
- `js/secureAuth.js` - New secure authentication module

**Files Modified**:
- `adminChecker.js` - Now uses secure authentication
- `teacherPortal.js` - Integrated with secure auth module

### 3. Testing Code Removal - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Testing bypasses in production code
**Solution**:
- Removed hardcoded testing credentials from `teacherPortal.js`
- Added proper authentication checks
- Users must now properly log in to access the system

**Files Modified**:
- `teacherPortal.js` - Lines 106-112

### 4. Configuration Security - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Firebase credentials exposed in client-side code
**Solution**:
- Removed hardcoded base64-encoded credentials
- Configuration now only comes from secure server endpoint
- Added proper error handling for missing configuration

**Files Modified**:
- `teacherPortal.js` - Lines 4-16

### 5. Input Sanitization - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: XSS vulnerabilities in user input handling
**Solution**:
- Created `js/inputSanitizer.js` - Comprehensive input sanitization
- Added HTML escaping for all user-generated content
- Sanitized form data before processing
- Added validation for email, username, and other fields

**Files Created**:
- `js/inputSanitizer.js` - Input sanitization utilities

**Files Modified**:
- `teacherPortal.js` - Added sanitization to student rendering and form handling
- `index.html` - Added sanitizer script
- `teacherPortal.html` - Added sanitizer script

### 6. Session Management - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Insecure session handling and no proper logout
**Solution**:
- Added secure logout functionality
- Proper session cleanup on logout
- Automatic token refresh
- Session validation on page load

**Files Modified**:
- `teacherPortal.js` - Added secure logout handler (Lines 133-149)

### 7. Data Consistency - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Level counting inconsistency (10 vs 12 levels)
**Solution**:
- Updated `calculateStudentProgress()` to use 12 levels
- Fixed student data fetching to handle 12 levels
- Consistent level handling throughout the system

**Files Modified**:
- `teacherPortal.js` - Lines 78, 406

### 8. Error Handling - IMPROVED ✅
**Problem**: Poor error handling and generic error messages
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling in authentication
- Better user feedback for different error types
- Graceful fallbacks for network errors

**Files Modified**:
- `js/secureAuth.js` - Comprehensive error handling
- `adminChecker.js` - Better error messages
- `teacherPortal.js` - Improved error handling

## Security Features Added

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Secure JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin/Teacher)
- ✅ Secure logout with session cleanup
- ✅ Authentication state validation

### Data Protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ XSS protection through HTML escaping
- ✅ Password security with bcrypt hashing
- ✅ Secure API communication

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Server-side configuration management
- ✅ Removal of client-side credential exposure
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. **Password Migration**: Run the password migration script to hash existing passwords
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all environment variables are properly set
3. **Server Testing**: Verify all API endpoints are working correctly
4. **Authentication Flow**: Test login/logout functionality thoroughly
5. **Input Validation**: Test with malicious input to verify sanitization

### Security Testing
1. **XSS Testing**: Attempt to inject scripts through form inputs
2. **Authentication Bypass**: Try to access protected pages without login
3. **Token Validation**: Test with expired/invalid tokens
4. **Input Validation**: Test with various malicious inputs

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Data
1. Run the password migration script: `node scripts/migrate-passwords.js`
2. Verify all existing passwords are properly hashed
3. Test login functionality with existing accounts

### For New Deployments
1. Set up all required environment variables
2. Deploy the server-side components first
3. Ensure the `/api/config` endpoint is working
4. Deploy the client-side files
5. Test the complete authentication flow

## Remaining Considerations

### Production Deployment
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled for all communications
- Set up proper CORS policies
- Configure rate limiting on the server
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Regular security audits

### User Education
- Inform users about password requirements
- Provide guidance on secure password practices
- Document the new login process

## Conclusion

All critical security flaws have been addressed:
- ✅ Plaintext password storage eliminated
- ✅ Secure authentication system implemented
- ✅ Input sanitization added
- ✅ Configuration security improved
- ✅ Testing code removed
- ✅ Session management secured
- ✅ Data consistency fixed

The system now follows security best practices and is ready for production deployment after proper testing and environment setup.
