# Dark/Light Mode Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the dark/light mode toggle feature implemented for the Teacher Portal and Dashboard pages.

## Features
- **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes via a toggle switch in the Settings modal
- **Persistent Preference**: Theme preference is saved to localStorage and persists across sessions
- **Smooth Transitions**: All theme changes include smooth CSS transitions for a polished user experience
- **Automatic Initialization**: Theme is applied immediately on page load based on saved preference

## Implementation Details

### 1. CSS Variables (main.css)
- Added dark mode CSS variable overrides using `body.dark-mode` selector
- Dark mode colors include:
  - Background: `#0f172a` (primary), `#1e293b` (secondary)
  - Sidebar: `#2d2418`
  - Text: `#f1f5f9` (primary), `#cbd5e1` (secondary)
  - Borders: `#334155` (light), `#475569` (medium)
  - Enhanced shadows for better visibility

### 2. Theme Toggle UI
- Added a new "Appearance" section in Settings
- Toggle switch with smooth slider animation
- Dynamic icon that changes between sun (light mode) and moon (dark mode)
- Visual feedback with hover effects

### 3. JavaScript (theme-switcher.js)
The theme switcher provides:
- `ThemeManager.init()`: Loads saved theme on page load
- `ThemeManager.toggle()`: Switches between themes
- `ThemeManager.enableDarkMode()`: Activates dark mode
- `ThemeManager.enableLightMode()`: Activates light mode
- Automatic event listener setup for all theme toggle buttons

### 4. localStorage Integration
- Theme preference is stored in localStorage with key `'userTheme'`
- Values: `'light'` or `'dark'`
- Default is `'light'` if no preference is saved

## Pages with Dark Mode Support

### Full Support (with Settings Toggle)
- **Teacher Portal** - Users can toggle theme in Settings
- **Admin Dashboard** - Users can toggle theme in Settings

### Theme-Aware (inherits preference)
- **Student Details Page** - Automatically applies saved theme
- **Teacher Info Page** - Automatically applies saved theme

All pages share the same theme preference via localStorage, so changing the theme in one location affects all pages.

## Usage

### For Users
1. Click on the "Settings" icon in the sidebar
2. Find the "Appearance" section at the top of Settings
3. Click the toggle switch to change between light and dark mode
4. The theme will be saved automatically and applied on future visits

### For Developers
To programmatically change the theme:
```javascript
// Switch to dark mode
window.ThemeManager.enableDarkMode();

// Switch to light mode
window.ThemeManager.enableLightMode();

// Toggle between themes
window.ThemeManager.toggle();

// Check current theme
const currentTheme = window.ThemeManager.getSavedTheme(); // Returns 'light' or 'dark'
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses localStorage (supported in all modern browsers)
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for theming
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Performance
- Theme is applied immediately on page load (no flash of wrong theme)
- Uses CSS custom properties for efficient theme switching
- No external dependencies required
- Minimal JavaScript footprint (~3KB)

## Future Enhancements
Possible improvements:
- System preference detection (match OS dark mode)
- Custom theme colors
- Scheduled theme switching (auto-switch at sunset/sunrise)
- Theme preview before applying
- Additional color schemes beyond dark/light

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Open Teacher Portal or Dashboard
2. Go to Settings
3. Toggle between light and dark mode
4. Verify theme persists after page reload
5. Check all UI elements render correctly in both themes
6. Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Troubleshooting

**Theme doesn't persist:**
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Clear localStorage and try again: `localStorage.clear()`

**Theme looks broken:**
- Clear browser cache
- Verify main.css is loading correctly
- Check browser console for errors

**Toggle not working:**
- Verify theme-switcher.js is loaded
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure Settings modal is properly initialized
